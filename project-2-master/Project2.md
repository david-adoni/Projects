# Problem Statement

I have been entrusted by a real estate invesment trust to create a machine learning algorithm to take in new data and predict housing prices. I have put together a model based on the data given by the Ames housing data set which has 81 variables total which are all listed in the data dictionary above. 

My goal is to make the model effective at predicting sale price using some of the variables that are most correlated with sale price. 

It is split into 3 notebooks: [Data Cleaning](https://git.generalassemb.ly/da111/David_A_Submissions/blob/master/projects/project-2-master/Code/Data_Cleaning.ipynb), [EDA](https://git.generalassemb.ly/da111/David_A_Submissions/blob/master/projects/project-2-master/Code/EDA.ipynb), and [Data Modeling](https://git.generalassemb.ly/da111/David_A_Submissions/blob/master/projects/project-2-master/Code/Data_models.ipynb). For data modeling I used the Linear Regression model to fit the data and evaluated it by using the root mean squared error.

## Executive Summary

The model that was used was the the linear regression model. It had a train score of 0.81 and test score of 0.86. The scores were not ideal but they can be improved to focus on the variables that have high correlation with SalePrice. 


What correlated best with sale price were the variables: 'overall_qual','exter_qual','gr_liv_area','kitchen_qual','garage_area','garage_cars'. Once I cleaned the variables and used them in my model, the score improved from the low 60 percentile to the low to mid 80 percentile. 


After using the model it became clear that it will need more refitting and modification to be able to work better. I recommend that based on the data the several variables mentioned before, higher sale prices are justified with the higher quality and size of the home's amenitites.
